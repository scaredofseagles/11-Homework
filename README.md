# Note-Taker

## Description

A web application used to keep track of tasks to complete that can read, write, and delete notes.

## Technnologies

* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Express.js

## Installation

````
npm install express fs path uuid
````

## Goal of the Project

**Create a web application that can read, write and delete notes**

As a note-taking web application, I needed to set html and api routes to be able to modify notes while rendering html files in a single-page application. Furthermore, I used the "fs" module to write to an .json file to save notes.

## Usage

The following image is an example of the web application's appearance and functionality:

## What I Did

#### Set API Endpoints

````
app.get('/', function(req, res){
    res.sendFile(__dirname + "/public/index.html")
})

app.get('/api/notes', function(req, res){
    res.send(noteList)
})
````

#### Provide a Unique ID

````
let id = uuid.v4()
let newNote = req.body
newNote.id = id
````

#### Write to File

````
let noteList = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(dbFile, "utf-8"))
fs.writeFileSync(dbFile, JSON.stringify(noteList))
````
